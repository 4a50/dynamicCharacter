Author: [4a50](https://github.com/4a50/)

### Description
Dynamic Character is an extention for the [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) app authored by [Oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/).  As like, loves or hates are generated by the Chatbot it is added to a custom character file and updated the context header.  The goal is to have a simple ***persistent*** memory. The charater attributes are stored in the *character.json* file and converted to the WPP format.

### Requirements

- Installed [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html) installed in the *conga* environment
- The repo copied to the */extensions* folder in *text-generation-webui*
- *--extentions dynamicCharater* added to */server.py* arguments.  See [text-generation-webui wiki](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki) for details

### Notes

- The chat history will be maintained as written
- The Context will be intercepted every generation and inserted with the custom character context.  
- The Chatbot response will be intercepted and run through NLTK to determine if any sentence meets criteria, then adds the NP(Noun phrase) to the character.json.
- Currently written only for likes.
